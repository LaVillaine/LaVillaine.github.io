I saw it with a white British friend of mine and he seemed embarrassed to enjoy it, like he felt wrong about ogling the African-ness for entertainment or something. :-S One critique I'd make about the film - did stopping the shipment of weapons imply that all the Africans in the world are 'the bad guy'?! I'd like to think that even if the shipment got through, it wouldn't inevitably lead to all-out war, and something more nuanced would've happened. I'm not sure."
