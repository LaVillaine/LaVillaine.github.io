Lie as clear as the sun. Convert the pure source of life into a stink sinister alcohol that derails minds. Jesus does not do that."

I have just one problem which is in the first paragraph, you wrote “but it is a work in progress which I suspect will take a few years.” I think “Expect” in place of “Suspect” is a more suitable word to use, business is not classic gambling, though one has to be daring at times with his/her choices. “Suspect” could be so distracting to some readers, because it doesn’t signify certainty. It also doesn’t reflect the enthusiastic nature of the writer."

I saw it with a white British friend of mine and he seemed embarrassed to enjoy it, like he felt wrong about ogling the African-ness for entertainment or something. :-S One critique I'd make about the film - did stopping the shipment of weapons imply that all the Africans in the world are 'the bad guy'?! I'd like to think that even if the shipment got through, it wouldn't inevitably lead to all-out war, and something more nuanced would've happened. I'm not sure."
