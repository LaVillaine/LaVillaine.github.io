While I do agree that everyone should get to wear what he or she wants to wear, when he or she wants to, they should also always take into consideration the appropriateness of their outfit for the occasion. What you wear at what event shows how well you take the situation. Whether that be dressing smartly for the office shows you take your job seriously, in a bikini for the beach indicates that you are there to have the most fun, etc.‚Ä¶How you dress also shows how comfortable and confident with yourself. For the women who do dress provocatively, they do tend to exude very high confidence. That is not to say that women who do aren‚Äôt, just that some can be good at their job and still choose to have fun while they are at it. Like I said, in the end, everyone is allowed to wear what he or she wants when he or she wants. Keeping that mind, they should also know when to dress appropriately when the situation might call for it. (e.g., no mini-skirts when in court, no bikinis at funerals, no bike shorts at work, and the like)."

I'd like to think that even if the shipment got through, it wouldn't inevitably lead to all-out war, and something more nuanced would've happened. I'm not sure."
