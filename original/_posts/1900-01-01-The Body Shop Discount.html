<div id="post-excerpt">
<p class="paragraph">Earlier this week I ordered some items from The Body Shop online when they had their 40% discount. I ordered the Tea Tree Toner (250 ml), Tea Tree Oil (20 ml) and Shea Body Butter (200 ml).</p>

<p class="paragraph">Unfortunately when the package came through, it was soaking wet. Upon opening it I discovered that the cap for the Toner and Butter had come loose. The toner had leaked through the entire packaging but the Oil was unaffected as it was individually wrapped in bubble wrap.</p>

<p class="paragraph">So after receiving the botched order I called The Body Shop customer services immediately and they put me through to their online orders department. The phone call was very brief and lasted less than 10 minutes. The lady on the phone asked me for details of my order such as Customer Reference, Delivery Address and so on. Once she'd retrieved my order details, she asked for a description of the damage. After this she offered to resend the damaged items to me via Next Day Delivery. The items arrived today as promised and in good condition.</p>

<p class="paragraph">I also got a friend referral link with a 30% discount off all online orders, which is obviously what you're interested in. The process is quite straightforward. When you click on the link, it takes you to a landing page as shown below. You enter your email address and a discount code is revealed to you. The code is of the following format <b>‘ME1234ABC’</b>. You then have 7 days to use that discount code on your online purchase at The Body Shop, after which it expires. Simple. </p>

<!--p class="paragraph">Please if you have a private profile make sure that it is made public for at least 24 hours if not I won't be able to verify what you've shared. Here comes the fine print. This discount only works for new customers of The Body Shop over the age of 18. So make sure that the email address you use to obtain the discount has never been used to order anything from The Body Shop. You can't use the discount in conjunction with any other discount on the same order. If you ask for a refund after you've placed the order, the discount will be revoked. Full Terms and Conditions can be found on the discount page, I have simply highlighted the key ones.</p-->

Full Terms and Conditions can be found on the discount page but I have highlighted the key ones below. A good tip is to create a stub email address just to obtain the discount.</p>
