      "content"	 : "                    I observed an interesting occurrence at work a few years ago which got me thinking about dress code etiquette in the corporate environment and what might or might not be considered appropriate work wear.                    As I was walking back to my desk from our breakout room, I observed that one of my co-workers, a new employee whom I had never had a chance to speak to before, had her dress hitched dangerously high up her thigh. When I use the term ‘dangerously’, I mean that it was hitched high enough for me to know she was wearing hold-ups and not tights. She was bent over another associate’s desk, a woman as well, while going over some paper work. I immediately thought to myself that this would be a good opportunity to make contact and speak to her. As I was making my way to where she was crouched I had another thought at the back of my mind; has anyone else noticed this? And if so why hadn’t they approached her to let her know? A little background on my office dynamic - women represent less than ten percent of the workforce.                    After apologising for interrupting them and introducing myself, I brought up the issue as casually as possible amid the little chit chat that ensued. “Oh! Thank you ever so much.”, she exclaimed while pulling the dress down. “I hadn’t realised what was going on with my dress”. I walked away feeling good about myself for having approached her and having addressed the issue in a seemingly non-aggravating way.                    As I sat at my desk musing about my accomplishments, the lady in question happened to be going back to her desk and we shared a complicit smile. But as she walked past me, I noticed something else. That dress was shockingly short. I was instantly dismayed. I couldn’t help but wonder why anyone would wear anything so short to the work place. Then again, I berated myself for mentally judging her outfit and decided to concentrate on the fact that she’d seemed to appreciate me warning her about the dress. Furthermore, it was a very nice dress and she looked gorgeous in it. So I brushed it aside.                    A week or so later, I noticed a male colleague staring intently at something a few paces ahead. As I moved my head around my monitor to see what had gripped his interest so much, I observed the same lady standing and talking to someone else with her back to me. I could see her bra clearly through her flimsy top. I had no doubt that this is what had arrested my fellow co-worker’s attention.                    Upon seeing this, I felt so uncomfortable for her. But then it occurred to me that I had no reason to. She was obviously conscious of the fact that the top was transparent and comfortable enough to wear it to the office. After this incident, I started noticing more and more that this lady was in the habit of wearing such revealing clothes. For the most part it made me feel self-conscious and I know for a fact that, had I been giving a presentation while wearing what she wore, I’d be asking myself if my team mates were staring through my top or paying attention to what I was saying. Clearly, that wasn’t an issue for her and I admired her confidence.                    On the day she was leaving the company, I overheard a colleague commenting to his co-worker, “Oh, no. There goes the eye candy!”. They both chuckled as they strode off. Needless to say, I wasn’t happy when I heard this. Firstly, because I was disappointed by the sexist implication of such a comment. Secondly, because I wondered whether people had taken the work she did seriously or if they simply viewed her as ‘eye candy’. Though our office space is open plan, she worked in a different department from me so I am unable to comment on the quality of her work. I have a high expectation of my colleagues, be they male or female, and I hope that they would have valued her work regardless of what she wore.                    It may seem that I have an issue with women wearing revealing clothes, but this is not the case. I have my fair share of crop tops, miniskirts and fishnet tops. I appreciate the fact that it is a free world and women have the right to wear whatever makes them look good without being apprehensive about what others will think or say. However, I would never wear a miniskirt and crop top to my work place. Simply because I think it is unprofessional.                    One might think it has something to do with the fact that I work in a male dominated environment and I am worried that wearing overtly revealing clothing will undermine the work that I do amongst my peers. Granted, that is an issue which often comes to mind. But my primary code of practice is to dress smart to work and leave the revealing clothes for other social outings. Conversely, I would feel uncomfortable if I observed a male colleague wearing a pair of cycling shorts or a tank top to the office. Although such outfits might be appropriate for the track or for the beach, I don’t think it is appropriate wear for a corporate environment.                    I recognise that my upbringing had a part to play in my views on the subject because whenever I went to work for my mum during the summer holidays in high school, I observed that her all-female staff dressed smartly, but never in an overtly revealing manner.  Nevertheless, I genuinely believe that some of these things lend themselves more to common sense than a difference in upbringing. There are certain environments which require a certain dress code and out of respect for such etiquette, one should dress accordingly. For example, I feel comfortable wearing a bikini at the beach or at the swimming pool but I wouldn’t wear one to a funeral service. Would you?",

      "content"	 : "                    Black Panther is the first Marvel Comics movie to be centred around an African superhero. There had been a lot of hype leading up to its premiere mainly because of its predominantly black cast and black director. In addition to these, it was filmed in South Africa, Zambia and Uganda amongst others. It was release in February which is celebrated as Black History Month in the USA. In fact, if you were black this was the movie to watch.                    I had never read any of the comics and therefore had never been familiar with the Black Panther character. Having enjoyed watching a few other Marvel movies, I was indeed curious to see how the movie would turn out. I was certainly drawn in by the hype; but how could this movie live up to such grand expectations? There was no need to worry. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the movie, but I also went about urging family and friends to watch it too.                    In this article I present a few factors which reveal the faithfulness of Africa&#39;s representation in Black Panther.Language                    In southern Cameroon, there is an ethnic group called Fang Beti and they speak Fang which is common to other ethnic groups in neighbouring countries such as Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and so on. In Fang, if you want to say ‘We are going home’, you would say ‘Wah-Kuh-Andah’. This is certainly how I felt as I watched the movie and heard the word ‘Wakanda’ spoken out. Although Wakanda is a fictitious place, I was very impressed to hear the actors speaking Xhosa which is one of the official languages of South Africa. Though heavily accented, I could tell that the actors had practiced the language extremely well and I was glad that the directors had chosen not to go for a fictitious language.Costume                    The realistic nature of the costumes and jewellery used is a real credit to the movie’s production designer and costume designer. T’Challa is featured wearing a Kente scarf in one of the scenes taking place in Busan. This fabric is native to the Akan people of Ghana, West Africa. Zuri’s flowing robes, are known as Gandoura in northern and central Africa. Bright blue blankets worn by W’Kabi are native to Lesotho. The Isicholo hat worn by queen Ramonda is a Zulu headdress and Ndebele neck rings worn by the Dora Milaje are native to parts of South Africa and southern Zimbabwe. Such a variety really shows how much effort was made to bring Africa’s diverse culture under one roof.                    Women                    The women of Wakanda brought an especially warm feeling to my heart. From their natural hairstyles to their fierce nature, they truly did justice to the African woman. I could totally relate to Okoye’s shaved head and Nakia’s short hair, which I sported in secondary school and during school holidays respectively. The Dora Milaje army are also reminiscent of the Dahomey Amazons which were an all-female military regiment of up to 6000 warriors in the Kingdom of Dahomey, present-day Republic of Benin. Although it isn’t clear whether or not the Dora Milaje were modelled after the Dahomey Amazons, it is certainly refreshing to see black women portrayed as fierce and loyal as opposed to the angry black woman stereotype.Wealth                    Talking about stereotypes, it is common practice to see African countries portrayed as starving backward third-world countries led by incompetent dictators which need to be rescued by foreign aid from Europe and the USA. It is true that this is prevalent in some African countries. However, many others are extremely rich in natural resources and quite a few of them are run by great leaders. I was enthralled to see Wakanda being portrayed as a nation thriving off its natural resources and making great technological advancements under the watchful eye of a diligent king.Rituals                    The practice of ancestral worship and spirit animal rituals was common to most parts of Africa before the advent of the Europeans. In fact, to this day, it is still practiced by many ethnic groups. In Cameroon, for example, twenty per cent of the population practice various forms of ancestral worship which is passed down from generation to generation. The movie does a great job bringing this practice to life during T’Challa’s coronation ceremony. His spirit animal becomes the black panther when, after performing certain rituals, he is initiated as King of Wakanda and gains the ability to communicate with his ancestors in the world beyond. This is quite similar to the initiation of chiefs in to the Ekpe secret society which is active in Nigeria, Cameroon and Cuba. Ekpe, which is also known as Leopard, is a mysterious jungle spirit presiding over the society’s ceremonies. Its members are said to act as messengers of the ancestors.                    Humour                    Not only was the movie steeped in culture, but it was also well laced with humour. I couldn’t help thinking about village elders when the camera zoomed in on T’Challa’s sandal clad feet. Neither could I help thinking about my cousin who actually took her driving test without shoes, when Nakia was shown driving bare footed while in Busan. The funniest scene to me was the one where M’baku threatens to feed Everret to his children. It might seem odd that an African tribe is vegetarian because most Africans today, including myself, are meat lovers. As a matter of fact, I don’t think there is a single vegetarian restaurant in Cameroon. However, unbeknownst to many, there are quite a few African tribes which are largely vegetarian. For example, the Dinkas of Sudan eat lots of grain and sea food while the Kikuyus of Kenya eat lots of grain, tubers and insects.                    ConclusionAll in all, the movie did a great job of representing the diversity of the African continent and presenting positive role models for future generations. Hopefully this movie will only be the beginning of many more of such to come.                    ",

      "content"	 : "This book is indeed an emotional rollercoaster. Prepare yourself for the ride of a lifetime.It is the story of Will. A rich, entitled bachelor who becomes a quadriplegic after getting hit by a motorcyclist. He sustains a spinal injury from the accident which causes him to be paralysed and confined to a wheelchair. As a result of this, he lost the zeal to live and he is determined to end his life on his own terms.Then there’s Camilla, his mother. Another rich, aloof and cold individual who loves her son desperately but for the life of her can’t seem to communicate this effectively. Though devastated by Will’s accident, she is determined to do everything in her power to keep him alive and well.This is where Lou comes in. Invisible, unassuming Lou. She’s employed by Camilla to be Will’s secondary carer. What she doesn’t know as she takes on this job is that she is part of an elaborate plan (Camilla’s plan) to prevent Will from ending his own life. What she thought would be a boring menial job turned out to be much more intricate than she could have imagined.If you’re worried about the fact that the two main protagonists are a man and a woman, let me reassure you that this is not a romance novel. The main premise of this book is assisted suicide and the author does a very good job of presenting the case from different viewpoints in an unbiased way.The characters develop progressively in such a way that the reader can easily relate to each of them. The reader also gets a glance into the life of a quadriplegic, and I must say this is one of the most affecting aspects of the book, apart from the obvious.After reading this book I developed a new found respect for people who are confined to wheelchairs. Generally, we tend to acknowledge the fact that their lives are more difficult than ours but many of us don’t actually realise to what extent it is. No matter what your opinion is on the premise of the book, I say give it a read anyway. I wasn’t disappointed, and I’m guessing you won’t be either.",

But these will need to be cooked for much longer before adding to the eru.If using defrosted eru leaves, drain them using a sieve instead of squeezing the water out. This prevents the leaves from becoming slimy.&amp;nbsp; Method Cook spinach on high heat for 5-10 minutes while stirring continuously. This will cause the vegetable to drain out water and reduce to about half its original size. When water dries up, switch off the fire. Wash and dice the beef, salt to taste and put in a pot. Blend onion and 1 chilli with 1/2 cup of water and pour this mixture into the pot.  Add another cup of water, 2 Maggi cubes and 1 Maggi Crevête cube. Boil beef on high heat for 30 minutes or until tender. While the beef is cooking, place the spinach back on the hob with medium heat and start adding the eru leaves - a handful at a time. When beef is done, remove it from the stock and put the snails into the pot. Boil the snails in beef stock for 15 minutes or until tender. Add boiled beef and snails to the mixture of spinach and eru. Also add crayfish and 2 finely chopped chillies. Stir properly then pour in the palm oil. Cover the pot and simmer on medium heat for 15 - 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Serve with garri or water fufu. Enjoy! ",

Or have you ever wondered why others may have decided to take that path? Well, I hope the piece below inspires you.                    I wrote this poem some time ago while reflecting on the reasons why I had decided to cut my hair in January last year. Before deciding to go natural my hair was relaxed and about 13 inches long so it was really a big deal.                    I worried about length and whether I could ever grow it back as long as before. Well I&#39;m glad I took the plunge. It&#39;s been a year and a half and my hair is already 7 inches long (stretched). In addition to that I have so much volume which I could never have achieved before. You&#39;re welcome to read up and pass it on.                    Today I decided to cut my hairI&#39;ll explain why I made this decisionThere was an underlying pang of fearIt&#39;s gone. I must bring this plan to fruitionAt birth, my hair was thick and black and woolSo tough to comb. It was hard to manageI always thought it was too much troubleMum relaxed it when I had come of ageNow I blended right in just like a dollHair straight, pressed flat. So limp and so lifelessYou won&#39;t spot me in a crowd, large or smallEasy to see I&#39;d lost my uniquenessToday I am leaving the doll factoryMy hair stands out.

	{
      "content"	 : "                    In the wake of NHS reforms and such there was an article some time last year about the famous neurosurgeon Dr Henry Marsh and his opinion of the prime minister&#39;s NHS policy. Needless to say it wasn&#39;t a very high opinion. Essentially, he accused the prime minister of having no vision and warned that this might lead to a permanent revolution of the NHS. Well, from his mouth to God&#39;s ears, we have all witnessed the NHS in turmoil over the course of the year. The article also quoted that the prime minister had been moved to tears after reading a memoir published by Mr Marsh the previous year. This memoir is titled ‘Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death and Brain Surgery’                                    This book is an account of his life as a neurosurgeon in a busy and modern hospital in London. I usually don’t enjoy reading real life stories because I feel like there usually isn’t enough escapism to allow me to get lost in the story. So this book is in fact one of its kind in my collection of novels. And boy, am I glad I bought it! The book definitely lived up to the hype. If you’re thinking ‘Oh no, this is going to be like Grey’s Anatomy right?’, I’ll have to say ‘wrong!’. Go read it. It is five star rated on the popular online retailer with over a thousand reviews and you won’t be disappointed. You’ll be turning the pages like you wouldn’t believe it.                    The book offers incredible insight into the life of a neurosurgeon and exposes the, sometimes unrealistic, expectations that patients have of their surgeons. For example, patients usually think doctors know absolutely everything about their condition as if having total understanding of the disease will give them total control of the situation. Obviously this is never the case. No matter how skilled or distinguished a surgeon is, he or she won’t be able to foresee certain things. For example, that an aneurysm applicator will malfunction during surgery and cause irreparable damage.                    There’s also a little reflection on the pre-modern NHS where medics didn’t count their hours but just went on with the job at hand. However now, a patient who has been starved for 6 hours in preparation for surgery might end up not having the surgery on that day because the surgeon in question had already clocked in their daily quota of hours. Meaning that, said patient will have to go through the same ordeal the next day. It makes you wonder where all the money we keep pouring into the NHS is going. Oh yeah, that’s right. Maybe it is going to the thousands of Pounds worth of single use equipment which is disposed of after every surgery. Or maybe it is going to the incessant red tape and over-governance which has been introduced by the government.                    A most surprising and unexpected factor that was covered in this book, from the neurosurgeon’s perspective, is thee different ways in which atheists and Christians react to the death of a loved one. Despite its action packed pages full of drama and intrigue, this book definitely taught me; my problems are so small compared to what most people are going through day by day. I cannot imagine suffering excruciating pain on one side of my face similar to having a hot knife pushed into my face, neither can I imagine becoming suicidal because I have OCD and can’t stop washing my hands. These prospects may seem ludicrous but it is the everyday reality for certain people.                    A caveat emptor though, if you are very squeamish this might not be the book for you. In certain places he goes into gory details such as pulling someone’s scalp over their forehead and folding it over their face or plastic bags full of severed human hands in various stages of dissection.",

      "content"	 : "Today Christians around the world are celebrating the ascension of Jesus Christ into heaven. This event is said to have taken place forty days after He rose from the dead and is therefore celebrated on the fortieth day of Easter.Indeed, it seems like it was only yesterday that I was munching on ‘dodo’ (fried plantains) and fish at my aunty Irene’s. So in the spirit of ‘Throwback Thursdays’ why don’t I bring it all back to mind before getting to the heart of the matter. We had green pitted olives for the appetizer, scrumptious carrot, cabbage and apple salad as a starter and a selection of chocolates and liqueurs for dessert. Now on to the mains: slow roasted leg of lamb with a hint of basil and mint, Jollof rice and fried plantains as well as oven grilled sea bream.I don’t think I would have given that up to feed the five thousand!The mysteries of the resurrection and ascension are fascinating to say the least and although these events have a lot of religious and spiritual significance, I would like to approach them from a modern day perspective. I’m not talking about people like Mr. Quiboloy from the Philippines who claims to be the ‘Son of God’ while taking money from millions of poor people in order to fund his ministry. Neither am I talking about any renown preacher, minister or priest for that matter. I’m talking about an almost invisible person from your neighbourhood who suddenly becomes the talk of the town.Take for example a park in your neighbourhood where people tend to hangout. Each time you go for a walk, you notice a small group of people – say less than ten – gathered around a woman who is narrating a story of some kind. One day your curiosity gets the better of you, so you decide to stop and see for yourself what is going on. After a few inquiries you are told that this person is a gifted storyteller and orator and apparently has a knack for predicting what will be the exact outcome of any situation that you may be unsure about in your life.Naturally you are skeptical about these rumours but also a little bit curious because after listening to one of her narratives, you admit to yourself that she is indeed very gifted. As you are about to leave, you hear one of the men in the group asking for the outcome of a certain doctor’s appointment, to discuss the meaning of some x-ray results which were taken a few weeks ago, following a bout of chronic coughing. Now you’re thinking to yourself that the man probably just has some kind of chest infection but you realise that he is a neighbour of yours so you decide to stick around and listen to what the prediction will be.The woman’s prediction is that the x-rays will show some sort of inoperable lung tumour and that he will die by the end of the week. Some of the other people gathered around the woman begin to panic and are worried about him but you just laugh this off and tell him that he’ll be fine. The woman responds by saying that he’ll be more than fine because on the day of his funeral, he will rise from his coffin and float into the skies to the place where he truly belongs. At this point everyone is laughing hysterically because they all assume that she’s joking. You simply think she’s gone bonkers.Sure enough as the week goes by, the prediction comes to pass. Resulting in a media uproar that leaves the masses in utter disbelief.One can only imagine the conspiracy theories being used in order to disprove what happened. This will definitely be a case of seeing is not believing as even those who were at the funeral will accuse their eyes of betraying them. Those who prepared the body for burial will probably swear that the morgue drawers had an uncanny resemblance to incubators. What about you? Were you not there when the prediction was made? Did you not laugh it off as the rantings of a mad woman? Yet you don’t believe what’s going on.What’s going through your mind? The man had never been a popular person, in fact you didn’t know him well enough. Now you’re wondering if he was some sort of genius who was not only able to fake his own death but who was rich enough or resourceful enough to acquire an incredibly tiny, silent, powerful jetpack which he used to launch himself into the clouds. But then if he masterminded all of it, did this imply that the storyteller was in on it as well? What about the doctor’s diagnosis? Surely he can’t just stay in the sky for good, right? Where did he go off to? Is there going to be some quest for his missing body? And the questions go on and on.Obviously none of the people who witnessed these events are satisfied by what their eyes have seen. They’re all looking for an alternative explanation. A loophole, maybe. The point being that with such a myriad of scientific discoveries and advances in technology we tend not to trust our own senses as we might otherwise. Some might say that the people whom Jesus appeared to after He rose from the dead and those who witnessed His ascension were more susceptible to believe because they didn’t have access to all these modern day tools which could have enabled them to question the events at hand. So they were probably at the disadvantage for lack of these. On the flip side one could say that ‘enlightened’ as we may be, we have been robbed of our sense of wonder and awe; making us more cynical and less attuned to what our intuition tells us.I think the latter rings truer that the former. As William Wordsworth once wrote1: ‘Little we see in nature that is ours; … For this, for everything, we are out of tune; … It moves us not – Great God!’1Barber, L. (2008).

      "content"	 : "When I saw an article on The Telegraph about Beyoncé in a new music video with Coldplay and Sonam Kapoor, it got me thinking about something I had witnessed in Cameroon. When I went back to Cameroon last year for the Christmas holidays I noticed a lot of women wearing sarees and churidars. My immediate reaction (in my head of course) was ‘hmm na so Indian dem di cam take over pays, anyhow ie fine. Na wa own diversity be this’. Then one day I came across a group of women, still in Cameroon, gossiping about some Indian guy and ‘that their mop dem way di so so smell like garlic’. This really pissed me off and I couldn&#39;t understand why some of us Cameroonians think it is fashionable to wear sarees while stereotyping Indians for having bad breath. Upon reading this article on The Telegraph it then occurred to me that this was an example of cultural appropriation. So what is cultural appropriation and why do we keep going on about it?I noticed that there are many examples in the west of white stars adopting certain aspects of black culture as cool and fashionable while failing to speak out on critical issues of white on black racism. Or everyday Britons wanting to go eat some authentic Caribbean food while making sure that the restaurant in question is not in a ‘shady’ neighbourhood. Obviously there&#39;s nothing wrong with a white person wanting to enjoy proper jerk chicken or having their hair done in cornrows. But what does it say about that person if they don&#39;t want to go to or be seen in a neighbourhood which has predominantly black people in it; or if they go ahead and call black women ‘nappy headed hoes’?Let&#39;s go ahead and consider these two examples: One, a teenage girl born to a Native American chief is kidnapped and forced to marry an Englishman. She is then taken to England and used as an icon to encourage the oppression of Native Americans by the English. Two, another teenage girl born to German Jews. Went into hiding with her family due to Hitler&#39;s oppression of Jews and wrote a diary that eventually became one of the most widely read books of our time.Now these two young women have had deeply traumatic lives. However Walt Disney has warped and romanticised the story of pocahontas into a money making fairytale with a happy ending. Can we imagine what would happen if the same was done with Anne Frank&#39;s story, maybe depicting her as some Jewish girl who eloped and lived happily ever after with a Nazi officer?Question is, where do we draw the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation? When does it become offensive for someone to adopt aspects of a culture that isn&#39;t theirs?",

      "content"	 : "The first book i read from this author was &#39;Half of a Yellow Sun&#39; and I absolutely loved it.Unlike Half of a Yellow Sun, Chimamanda&#39;s Americanah is actually a love story. I was engrossed from the start with the story of Ifemelu&#39;s life in America and what she was ready to leave behind when she decided to move back to Nigeria. Most of us being in her shoes wouldn&#39;t have the courage to give up all that. I was so caught up in her love story with Obinze and their blind conviction that they would make it work when she moved to America. They had a plan and it would work! Well, haven&#39;t we all been there?What makes this book special is the fact that it doesn&#39;t only concentrate on the two protagonists. There are other characters whose stories have been well developed and provide a deeper context with which to draw in the reader. It also gives a near-accurate description of the way race is perceived by most people in Nigeria, UK and USA.I really loved Obinze&#39;s character and how he ironically got married to a woman whose qualities matched those of a girl he had previously refused to date back in high school. However the story of his life abroad almost brought tears to my eyes. It was heartbreaking and yet reflects how so many people struggle when they travel abroad to find a better life.I was also intrigued by how Ifemelu dealt with race-related issues when she was abroad. She seemed so vocal at times, speaking her mind without restraint. However in other occasions she just holds back and decides to keep quiet about things that she clearly finds offensive.Overall this book was wonderful and endearing. I would highly recommend.",

	{
      "content"	 : "Just rediscovered this book by Chinua Achebe and it really struck a chord. I had actually read the simplified edition when I was younger and recently came across a really negative review of the book on goodreads. This review prompted me to read the book again just to see things from the reviewer&#39;s point of view and I must say it felt like we both read two completely different books.The story of Okonkwo the great warrior and how he fell from grace is such a compelling tragedy. In part one Achebe does a really good job of portraying the nature and practices of the Igbo tribes. Personally their practices seemed really extreme but I like the fact that he neither showers them with praise nor criticism. He simply states them as they are.It is clear that Okonkwo has a lot of daddy issues. As a result he is very determined not to allow his father&#39;s short comings to ruin his life. Unfortunately arrogance is another vice that contributes greatly to his downfall. I especially like the parable of the tortoise attending a party in the sky which teaches a very good lesson about inter-personal relationships.Things really begin to fall apart when the British missionaries come to spread the gospel in the surrounding villages. I believe that if the foreigners had stopped at spreading the word a lot of the ensuing conflict could have been averted. Unfortunately this was one of the ploys of colonialism / imperialism in which they used their religion to gain ground and confidence within the tribes and then started imposing their statutes and governance on the local people.The fact that some of the clans men weren&#39;t united to a common cause also contributed to their downfall. This can be seen in the situation where the court messengers (local people working for the white people) disrespected their own elders who where held in custody and collected bribes from the villagers in addition to the initial fine required to release the elders.This was a very dramatic book. Go read it if you haven&#39;t already.",
