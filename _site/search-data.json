      "content"	 : "Today Christians around the world are celebrating the ascension of Jesus Christ into heaven. This event is said to have taken place forty days after He rose from the dead and is therefore celebrated on the fortieth day of Easter.Indeed, it seems like it was only yesterday that I was munching on ‘dodo’ (fried plantains) and fish at my aunty Irene’s. So in the spirit of ‘Throwback Thursdays’ why don’t I bring it all back to mind before getting to the heart of the matter. We had green pitted olives for the appetizer, scrumptious carrot, cabbage and apple salad as a starter and a selection of chocolates and liqueurs for dessert. Now on to the mains: slow roasted leg of lamb with a hint of basil and mint, Jollof rice and fried plantains as well as oven grilled sea bream.I don’t think I would have given that up to feed the five thousand!The mysteries of the resurrection and ascension are fascinating to say the least and although these events have a lot of religious and spiritual significance, I would like to approach them from a modern day perspective. I’m not talking about people like Mr. Quiboloy from the Philippines who claims to be the ‘Son of God’ while taking money from millions of poor people in order to fund his ministry. Neither am I talking about any renown preacher, minister or priest for that matter. I’m talking about an almost invisible person from your neighbourhood who suddenly becomes the talk of the town.Take for example a park in your neighbourhood where people tend to hangout. Each time you go for a walk, you notice a small group of people – say less than ten – gathered around a woman who is narrating a story of some kind. One day your curiosity gets the better of you, so you decide to stop and see for yourself what is going on. After a few inquiries you are told that this person is a gifted storyteller and orator and apparently has a knack for predicting what will be the exact outcome of any situation that you may be unsure about in your life.Naturally you are skeptical about these rumours but also a little bit curious because after listening to one of her narratives, you admit to yourself that she is indeed very gifted. As you are about to leave, you hear one of the men in the group asking for the outcome of a certain doctor’s appointment, to discuss the meaning of some x-ray results which were taken a few weeks ago, following a bout of chronic coughing. Now you’re thinking to yourself that the man probably just has some kind of chest infection but you realise that he is a neighbour of yours so you decide to stick around and listen to what the prediction will be.The woman’s prediction is that the x-rays will show some sort of inoperable lung tumour and that he will die by the end of the week. Some of the other people gathered around the woman begin to panic and are worried about him but you just laugh this off and tell him that he’ll be fine. The woman responds by saying that he’ll be more than fine because on the day of his funeral, he will rise from his coffin and float into the skies to the place where he truly belongs. At this point everyone is laughing hysterically because they all assume that she’s joking. You simply think she’s gone bonkers.Sure enough as the week goes by, the prediction comes to pass. Resulting in a media uproar that leaves the masses in utter disbelief.One can only imagine the conspiracy theories being used in order to disprove what happened. This will definitely be a case of seeing is not believing as even those who were at the funeral will accuse their eyes of betraying them. Those who prepared the body for burial will probably swear that the morgue drawers had an uncanny resemblance to incubators. What about you? Were you not there when the prediction was made? Did you not laugh it off as the rantings of a mad woman? Yet you don’t believe what’s going on.What’s going through your mind? The man had never been a popular person, in fact you didn’t know him well enough. Now you’re wondering if he was some sort of genius who was not only able to fake his own death but who was rich enough or resourceful enough to acquire an incredibly tiny, silent, powerful jetpack which he used to launch himself into the clouds. But then if he masterminded all of it, did this imply that the storyteller was in on it as well? What about the doctor’s diagnosis? Surely he can’t just stay in the sky for good, right? Where did he go off to? Is there going to be some quest for his missing body? And the questions go on and on.Obviously none of the people who witnessed these events are satisfied by what their eyes have seen. They’re all looking for an alternative explanation. A loophole, maybe. The point being that with such a myriad of scientific discoveries and advances in technology we tend not to trust our own senses as we might otherwise. Some might say that the people whom Jesus appeared to after He rose from the dead and those who witnessed His ascension were more susceptible to believe because they didn’t have access to all these modern day tools which could have enabled them to question the events at hand. So they were probably at the disadvantage for lack of these. On the flip side one could say that ‘enlightened’ as we may be, we have been robbed of our sense of wonder and awe; making us more cynical and less attuned to what our intuition tells us.I think the latter rings truer that the former. As William Wordsworth once wrote1: ‘Little we see in nature that is ours; … For this, for everything, we are out of tune; … It moves us not – Great God!’1Barber, L. (2008).

      "content"	 : "When I saw an article on The Telegraph about Beyoncé in a new music video with Coldplay and Sonam Kapoor, it got me thinking about something I had witnessed in Cameroon. When I went back to Cameroon last year for the Christmas holidays I noticed a lot of women wearing sarees and churidars. My immediate reaction (in my head of course) was ‘hmm na so Indian dem di cam take over pays, anyhow ie fine. Na wa own diversity be this’. Then one day I came across a group of women, still in Cameroon, gossiping about some Indian guy and ‘that their mop dem way di so so smell like garlic’. This really pissed me off and I couldn&#39;t understand why some of us Cameroonians think it is fashionable to wear sarees while stereotyping Indians for having bad breath. Upon reading this article on The Telegraph it then occurred to me that this was an example of cultural appropriation. So what is cultural appropriation and why do we keep going on about it?I noticed that there are many examples in the west of white stars adopting certain aspects of black culture as cool and fashionable while failing to speak out on critical issues of white on black racism. Or everyday Britons wanting to go eat some authentic Caribbean food while making sure that the restaurant in question is not in a ‘shady’ neighbourhood. Obviously there&#39;s nothing wrong with a white person wanting to enjoy proper jerk chicken or having their hair done in cornrows. But what does it say about that person if they don&#39;t want to go to or be seen in a neighbourhood which has predominantly black people in it; or if they go ahead and call black women ‘nappy headed hoes’?Let&#39;s go ahead and consider these two examples: One, a teenage girl born to a Native American chief is kidnapped and forced to marry an Englishman. She is then taken to England and used as an icon to encourage the oppression of Native Americans by the English. Two, another teenage girl born to German Jews. Went into hiding with her family due to Hitler&#39;s oppression of Jews and wrote a diary that eventually became one of the most widely read books of our time.Now these two young women have had deeply traumatic lives. However Walt Disney has warped and romanticised the story of pocahontas into a money making fairytale with a happy ending. Can we imagine what would happen if the same was done with Anne Frank&#39;s story, maybe depicting her as some Jewish girl who eloped and lived happily ever after with a Nazi officer?Question is, where do we draw the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation? When does it become offensive for someone to adopt aspects of a culture that isn&#39;t theirs?",

      "content"	 : "The first book i read from this author was &#39;Half of a Yellow Sun&#39; and I absolutely loved it.Unlike Half of a Yellow Sun, Chimamanda&#39;s Americanah is actually a love story. I was engrossed from the start with the story of Ifemelu&#39;s life in America and what she was ready to leave behind when she decided to move back to Nigeria. Most of us being in her shoes wouldn&#39;t have the courage to give up all that. I was so caught up in her love story with Obinze and their blind conviction that they would make it work when she moved to America. They had a plan and it would work! Well, haven&#39;t we all been there?What makes this book special is the fact that it doesn&#39;t only concentrate on the two protagonists. There are other characters whose stories have been well developed and provide a deeper context with which to draw in the reader. It also gives a near-accurate description of the way race is perceived by most people in Nigeria, UK and USA.I really loved Obinze&#39;s character and how he ironically got married to a woman whose qualities matched those of a girl he had previously refused to date back in high school. However the story of his life abroad almost brought tears to my eyes. It was heartbreaking and yet reflects how so many people struggle when they travel abroad to find a better life.I was also intrigued by how Ifemelu dealt with race-related issues when she was abroad. She seemed so vocal at times, speaking her mind without restraint. However in other occasions she just holds back and decides to keep quiet about things that she clearly finds offensive.Overall this book was wonderful and endearing. I would highly recommend.",

      "content"	 : "Just rediscovered this book by Chinua Achebe and it really struck a chord. I had actually read the simplified edition when I was younger and recently came across a really negative review of the book on goodreads. This review prompted me to read the book again just to see things from the reviewer&#39;s point of view and I must say it felt like we both read two completely different books.The story of Okonkwo the great warrior and how he fell from grace is such a compelling tragedy. In part one Achebe does a really good job of portraying the nature and practices of the Igbo tribes. Personally their practices seemed really extreme but I like the fact that he neither showers them with praise nor criticism. He simply states them as they are.It is clear that Okonkwo has a lot of daddy issues. As a result he is very determined not to allow his father&#39;s short comings to ruin his life. Unfortunately arrogance is another vice that contributes greatly to his downfall. I especially like the parable of the tortoise attending a party in the sky which teaches a very good lesson about inter-personal relationships.Things really begin to fall apart when the British missionaries come to spread the gospel in the surrounding villages. I believe that if the foreigners had stopped at spreading the word a lot of the ensuing conflict could have been averted. Unfortunately this was one of the ploys of colonialism / imperialism in which they used their religion to gain ground and confidence within the tribes and then started imposing their statutes and governance on the local people.The fact that some of the clans men weren&#39;t united to a common cause also contributed to their downfall. This can be seen in the situation where the court messengers (local people working for the white people) disrespected their own elders who where held in custody and collected bribes from the villagers in addition to the initial fine required to release the elders.This was a very dramatic book. Go read it if you haven&#39;t already.",
