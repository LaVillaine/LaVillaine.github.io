	<p>They spin a web of lies</p>
	<p>That what they have for sale</p>
	<p>Costs nothing more than ale</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Not wanting to disturb</p>
	<p>The careful balance met</p>
	<p>They draw you in their net</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Promising all the while</p>
	<p>What they do not possess</p>
	<p>Honesty and progress</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>How sweet their words doth sound</p>
	<p>Prospect of dreams come true</p>
	<p>Or too good to be true</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Little do we suspect</p>
	<p>It's nothing but a ruse</p>
	<p>A game we're sure to lose</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Allowing them to poise</p>
	<p>Like experts that they are</p>
	<p>The final blow to cast</p>
	<p>And steal the dream right back!</p>
