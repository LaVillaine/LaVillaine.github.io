<div id="post-excerpt">
                    <p  class="paragraph">I am very excited to be receiving the Young Woman Engineer of the year award. Getting through to this stage of the competition has been a challenging yet rewarding experience and I am especially grateful to the committee members who found value in my work and shortlisted me for the award.</p>
</div><!--excerpt-->
                    <p class="paragraph">I would like to thank the STEM ambassador organisers at Renishaw PLC for giving me the opportunity to volunteer in schools and local community events around Staffordshire. It has been such a delight encouraging young children to take on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by way of talks, presentations and hands-on activities.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">I am extremely thankful to the chairman of the IET’s Young Professionals committee in Birmingham for giving me the opportunity to inspire other young engineers through events I organised such as the Present Around the World competition and the Young Entrepreneurs competition.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">I would also like to mention the vice-president of Hidden No More Cameroon who invited me to be part of this wonderful charity which is aimed at sponsoring young Cameroonian girls in the STEM fields. Being a part of this charity has strengthened my resolve to educate and encourage more young women to be involved in STEM fields. It has opened my eyes to a wealth of talent that these girls possess and all it takes in most cases is a little guidance and motivation to see them perform at their full potential.</p>
					
					<p class="paragraph">Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family, especially my mum, without whose support and encouragement I wouldn’t be who I am today. Thank you all and God bless.</p>
