## Method

Tip: Buy pre-wrapped / frozen ekwang to speed things up in the kitchen

❇❇❇❇❇

1. Boil meat with onion, pepper, salt and maggi cube until tender
2. Line the ekwang around the sides of the pot and leave a space in the middle
3. Pour the palm oil into the middle of the pot and allow it to heat up
4. Once the oil starts to separate, pour about half a litre of boiling water in to the oil
5. Add the fish, cover the pot and allow to simmer on medium heat for 10 minutes
6. Now add the meat stock and stir gently to avoid scattering the ekwang
7. At this point add pepper,salt or maggi if required
8. Allow to simmer on medium heat for 10 more minutes
9. At this point the soup should start to thicken, add meat and crayfish
10. Cook on medium heat for another 10 minutes before serving
