<blockquote class="reduced-blockquote">
    <p>They filed out of the enchanted hut with grim faces.</p>
    <p>“Woman! You have grieved our ancestors,” proclaimed the speaker.</p>
    <p>Drums rolled as the villagers awaited her sentence.</p>
    <p>“You are no longer part of us.</p>
    <p>Leave now, and return no more.”</p>
    <p>Looking back one last time</p>
    <p>At their forlorn faces,</p>
    <p>She inhaled deeply,</p>
    <p>Then whispered,</p>
    <p>“Freedom!”</p>
    
    <p></p>
