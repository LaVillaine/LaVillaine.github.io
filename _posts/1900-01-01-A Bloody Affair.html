<blockquote class="reduced-blockquote">
    <p>Please don’t walk out on me,</p>
    <p>I promise to do right by you.</p>
    <p>Look over here, my love;</p>
    <p>My arm bleeds like my heart</p>
    <p>Twice torn. Yes, drop your keys</p>
    <p>And run fast to my aid.</p>
    <p>You’ll find bandages in the cabinet</p>
    <p>Above the sink. Blood drips slowly</p>
    <p>Onto the kitchen floor; </p>
    <p>The sight of it gives me a rush – </p>
    <p>Now I know what lengths </p>
    <p>I’d go to, to keep your heart beating</p>
    <p>For me, as mine does for you.</p>
    <p>I’d cut up my other arm,</p>
    <p>And my legs too. I’d do it over</p>
    <p>And over again, until I become</p>
    <p>Nothing but muscle and sinew – </p>
    <p>Bleeding for your attention and affection.</p>
    <p>I know at times you doubt our love,</p>
    <p>But whatever it is that I feel,</p>
    <p>I know that you feel it too.</p>
    <p>And try as you might to leave,</p>
    <p>Your heart won’t let you.</p>
    <p>I inhale your scent as, bandage in hand,</p>
    <p>You bend down with care</p>
    <p>To mend my wounded flesh.</p>
    <p>I begin to sob silently</p>
    <p>At the pain in your eyes; </p>
    <p>Yet, my heart is full.</p>
    <p>Not because I made you stay again,</p>
    <p>But because I realise </p>
    <p>Just how much you love me.</p>
    <p>Your love for me is beyond </p>
    <p>My wildest dreams. You stay</p>
    <p>Even when there’s nothing but pain.</p>
    <p>There’s no life without you,</p>
    <p>And no love without bloodshed.</p>
    <p>I’d gladly shed my blood</p>
    <p>And give my life for you.</p>
    <p>I watch you rise</p>
    <p>To clean up the floor;</p>
    <p>Your step is as sure</p>
    <p>As my love is for you. </p>
    <p>In a few sweeping moves,</p>
    <p>The bloody mess is wiped off – </p>
    <p>The floor is no longer marred</p>
    <p>By my act of penitence.</p>
    <p>I lift myself off the cold hard tiles</p>
    <p>And hug you tightly from behind.</p>
    <p>I know that everything</p>
    <p>Will be alright now. </p>
    <p>You won’t walk out on me.</p>
    <p>My heart’s in yours and yours in mine.</p>
    <p></p>
